## Goals of this Users Group:
1. Discuss ongoing work using single cell methods with colleagues at NIH using similar techniques.
2. Coordinate regular meetings to present work in a friendly environment to gain feedback and suggestions.
3. Discuss hurdles that arise in the course of our research in topic-focused discussion sessions.

***
## Meeting Formats

### 2 x 20min Presentations
1. Data sharing session where two people using single cell for their research present their work
2. Friendly environment to get feedback and suggestions

### Discussion Sections
1. Open format meeting to discuss a topic, technique, or recent paper(s)
2. Moderator organized; participant led

## How do I get notified about upcoming events?

Join the Single Cell Genomics SIG listserv.

For joining the Single Cell Genomics SIG listserv:
1. Go here: <a href="https://list.nih.gov" class="external" target="_blank">NIH Listerv Website</a>
2. You may need to set up an account – this is a different login process than your NIH ID, since it is accessible to non-NIH folks too.
3. Login, search for “singlecellgenomics-l” and subscribe

This will allow you to subscribe to this listserv and you should be able to see some of the message archives on there as well.



## Get Involved

If you would like to present or lead a discussion group, please contact one of us on the organizing team (you can find our email addresses on NIH global).
