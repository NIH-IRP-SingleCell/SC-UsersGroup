For joining the Single Cell Genomics SIG listserv:
1. Go here: <a href="https://list.nih.gov" class="external" target="_blank">NIH Liserv Website</a>
2. You may need to set up an account – this is a different login process than your NIH ID, since it is accessible to non-NIH folks too.
3. Login, search for “singlecellgenomics-l” and subscribe

This will allow you to subscribe to this listserv and you should be able to see some of the message archives on there as well.
